    <a href="{{ site.url }}">The Unofficial Guide to the University of Michigan (AA) Acronyms & Abbreviations</a>
  </div>
</header>


<div class="intro">
There's a formal name, and a colloquial name to everything and sometimes it's hard to remember what means what.  We've all used them: the Ugli for the Undergraduate Library or EECS for the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science building.  For those new to campus, navigating around Ann Arbor can be a challenge when you're first starting out.  That's why we’ve created this unofficial guide to the acronyms & abbreviations for places and things in and around University of Michigan Ann Arbor’s campus.
<br />
We created this guide as grad students who found it hard to keep up with all the Umich and Ann Arbor lingo and ultimately found ourselves showing up to the wrong classroom on the first day of class, pretending we knew what an acronym was when in came up in conversation and then frantically looking it up later to no avail, or having to be the person that asked what something was and felt silently judged. 
<br />
We’re here to make your life easier by serving as a resource to mastering campus and Ann Arbor.
